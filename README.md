# CMB Assignment 02 code + notebooks

This is a project for containing code for the second assignment of the Connected Mobility Basics lecture.

## Analysis Code

Under the folder `analysis` you can find jupyter notebook we used for the figure creation for our analysis report.

## Python Code

Also in this repository you can find the code we used to capture our traffic data. We used the script `capture.sh` under a 15 min cronjob to create and process the traffic data into json files. These json files are then used by the jupyter notebooks.
